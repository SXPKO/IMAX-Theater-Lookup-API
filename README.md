## 🔒 Security

Security is a top priority for this API. It uses rate limiting to control the number of requests and prevent abuse. You can customize the rate limit settings in the configuration file.

### API Key Management

The API manages its keys through Firebase, ensuring that each request is authenticated. Make sure to secure your API keys and never expose them in public repositories.
