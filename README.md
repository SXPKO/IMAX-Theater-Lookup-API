# 🎥 IMAX Theater Lookup API 🌍

Welcome to the **IMAX Theater Lookup API**! This project is a comprehensive solution designed to help you find and manage IMAX theaters across the globe. Whether you're a movie enthusiast or a developer looking to integrate theater data into your application, this API provides everything you need.

## 🚀 Overview

The IMAX Theater Lookup API is built using **Node.js** with the **Express** framework and is powered by a **PostgreSQL** database. It allows users to retrieve data about IMAX theaters, add new theaters, and update existing information. With secure management of API keys using **Firebase**, this API ensures robust performance and security. The entire application runs smoothly within a **Docker** container, making it easy to deploy and manage.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Access information about all IMAX theaters worldwide.
- **Add Theaters**: Insert new theaters into the database.
- **Edit Existing Theaters**: Update information for existing theaters.
- **Secure API Keys**: Manage API keys efficiently with Firebase.
- **Containerized Application**: Runs in Docker for easy setup and deployment.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of the API with built-in rate limiting.
- **Logging**: Utilize Winston for robust logging capabilities.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Firebase Account

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SXPKO/IMAX-Theater-Lookup-API.git
   cd IMAX-Theater-Lookup-API
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and include your Firebase and database configuration.

3. **Run Docker Container**:
   To build and run the application in a Docker container, use:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the API**:

### 🌐 API Endpoints

Here’s a quick overview of the available endpoints:

- **GET /theaters**: Retrieve a list of all IMAX theaters.
- **POST /theaters**: Add a new IMAX theater.
- **PUT /theaters/:id**: Update an existing IMAX theater by ID.
- **DELETE /theaters/:id**: Remove a theater from the database.

### Example Requests

#### Retrieve All Theaters

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/theaters
```

#### Add a New Theater

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/theaters \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "name": "New IMAX Theater",
    "location": "123 Movie St, Film City",
    "capacity": 300
}'
```

#### Update an Existing Theater

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/theaters/1 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "capacity": 350
}'
```

#### Delete a Theater

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/theaters/1
```

## 🔒 Security

Security is a top priority for this API. It uses rate limiting to control the number of requests and prevent abuse. You can customize the rate limit settings in the configuration file.

### API Key Management

The API manages its keys through Firebase, ensuring that each request is authenticated. Make sure to secure your API keys and never expose them in public repositories.

## 📊 Logging

We utilize **Winston** for logging API requests and errors. This allows you to keep track of the application’s performance and diagnose issues effectively.

### Logging Levels

- **info**: General information about the application.
- **warn**: Indications of potential issues.
- **error**: Critical errors that require immediate attention.

## 🎨 Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: Fast web framework for Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful, open-source relational database.
- **Firebase**: Cloud-based service for managing API keys and user authentication.
- **Docker**: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Winston**: Versatile logging library for Node.js.
